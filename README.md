Skeleton
=====================

It took days, weeks and months before I was able to settle to structure that works for me and give me this feeling of contentment. And you are guilty too of looking for the best structure, at least what works best for you.

----------

What is skeleton
----------

- Skeleton **is an application seed** for your *expressjs* apps.
- Skeleton **is not a framework** or it will ever be.


Why another one?
---------

With all those tutorials and articles over the internet that uses a specific structure on how they organize an **expressjs** application, why another one? That is because, imho, these articles do not talk about what is what, what does what, in details. Even today, I follow tutorials that I cannot understand what each piece of code does and I do not know if each specific code block is a requirement, or maybe those are just results of copy and pasting. That I don't know.

>  - I know what's going on by heart
>  - This is how I learn


How do I do it?
----------

At the time of the writing of this README, there hasn't been a single line of code in this repository.  This repository will contain the scaffolding branch or the **Skeleton**. Then all other repo based on this will be explained in detail in their own *README* files, and probably an article in my blog.

Is this the best? Obviously the answer is no, but right now, this what works for me.

Improvements
----------

That's what this public repo is all about. Evangelize me, convince me why your patch, or maybe if you have baddass repo that you think is a lot, i mean a lot better than mine, feel free to tell me, and if there are incredibly large flaw in mine, tell me. This is how I learn.
